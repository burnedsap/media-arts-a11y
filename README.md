# Media Arts A11yÂ Template

## Introduction

The A11y Media Arts Website Template is a quickstart guide to help you make a class website which is accessible and easy to create. Although primarily intended for teachers and educators, this template can be used by anyone to create accessibility friendly websites. The template can be downloaded as a .zip file or remixed as a project on Glitch.com. The template is accompanied by this guide which explains the design and development of the website. This is intended to quickly get you up to speed on the basics of creating accessibility friendly web development, not a comprehensive guide.

This is an open-source project, and contributions are very welcome! We'd like to continue refining this template, with the hope of making the web more accessible, by making it easy to create accessible websites.
